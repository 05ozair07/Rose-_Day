          <span>Dear Maahi,</span>
          <br />
          Though the official day for roses has come, 
          the feeling of sweetness and appreciation lingers. 
          And let me tell you, you deserve a bouquet bigger than any garden can offer! 
          You bring so much joy and beauty into my life, just like a rose in full bloom. 
          Your warmth, kindness, and laughter fill my days with sunshine, and your strength and resilience
          inspire me to be a better person. Thank you for being you, my paglu dost.
            Here's to many more days of shared smiles and the fragrant memories we create together.
          <br />
